# 🧬 Wang Lab at the University of Florida

Welcome to the **Wang Lab** at the University of Florida’s  
**Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology** and **Emerging Pathogens Institute**.  
We develop **AI foundation models** to study virus–immunity coevolution and guide vaccine design.

---

### 🔬 Research Focus  
- Antibody and viral co-evolution  
- Foundation models for immunology and vaccine design  
- Deep mutational learning and sequence–structure–function mapping
